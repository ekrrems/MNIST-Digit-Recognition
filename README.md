# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
We try to predict the numbers written on a drawing pad

<p> After importing required libraries on our environment we try to create a CNN Model with MNIST Image data(MNIST Digit Detection.py). Afterwards we save the model and load it to another file. Then we create a drawing pad and make the prediction of the written number then make it appear on the drawing pad(Prediction of UI.py).</p>
